     <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

          <h2> WHY CODING ?</h2>
        </div>
<p align="center" >I’ve been a little lost when it comes to what do as a career.
I’ve always loved creating, wether it was  dancing competitvely,singing, 
creating vlogs or photography. 
I studied chemistry at university per my parents request but quickly 
realised it wasn’t for me. 
I continued with photography until some friends of mine recommended 
that I look into web design. 
I started learning a little through the ‘mimo’ app and found that I 
enjoyed the combination of problem solving and creativity. 
I hope to go into front end development and continue developing my 
skills in a field that will never be boring. 
I was actually directed to Founders and Coders by a complete stranger, 
I said I was interested in getting into tech and she kindly sent me 
some resources and information about this course.
