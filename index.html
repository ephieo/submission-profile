     <p>
      Hi, My name is Ephie Oyedoh. 
      I was born in Nigeria and raised in the UK, while my mum was born in the UK and raised in Nigeria. It’s like life played the Uno reverse card. I studied Chemistry at University because I liked too many things to pinpoint what I liked the most. My mum is a Biomedical Scientist and my dad was an Accountant so they chose my route for me because I couldn’t choose. 
      I’m sure you can tell how that went. Although I liked the problem-solving in chemistry I lacked the passion. I hurt my knee in my final year and ended up having to choose to graduate with a third (due to missed classes, labs, and assignments while in hospital) or retake the year. After three years I decided to come home and figure out what I wanted to do. Since graduation I’ve worked as a production coordinator for a university game-show called ‘The Big Clash Gameshow’, I’ve worked in hospitality and retail and then trained as a barista and I also started my photography business (Koinonia).

I heard about F&C from a regular customer that I told about my interests in tech. I mentioned it off hand one day and she put my in touch with someone who had just finished the course. 
I was drawn in by the peer-lead teaching, I have experience mentoring and teaching from working as a crew-trainer and also teaching photo-editing. I've always been a fan of giving back so the oppurtunity to help others who may be in the same situation as me is inspiring.

          <h2> WHY CODING ?</h2>
          <p align="center" >I’ve been a little lost when it comes to what do as a career.
            I’ve always loved creating, wether it was  dancing competitvely,singing, 
            creating vlogs or photography. 
            When I quickly realised that chemistry wasn’t for me, I focused more on sharpening my creative skills. 
            I continued with photography until some friends of mine recommended 
            that I look into web design. 
            I started learning a little through the ‘mimo’ app and found that I 
            enjoyed the combination of problem solving and creativity. 
            I hope to go into front end development and continue developing my 
            skills in a field that will never be boring.
