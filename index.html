      Hi, My name is Ephie Oyedoh. 
      I was born in Nigeria and raised in the UK, while my mum was born in the UK and raised in Nigeria. It’s like life played the Uno reverse card. I studied Chemistry at University because I liked too many things to pinpoint what I liked the most. My mum is a Biomedical Scientist and my dad was an Accountant so they chose my route for me because I couldn’t choose. 
      I’m sure you can tell how that went. Although I liked the problem-solving in chemistry I lacked the passion. I hurt my knee in my final year and ended up having to choose to graduate with a third (due to missed classes, labs, and assignments while in hospital) or retake the year. After three years I decided to come home and figure out what I wanted to do. Since graduation I’ve worked as a production coordinator for a university game-show called ‘The Big Clash Gameshow’, I’ve worked in hospitality and retail and then trained as a barista and I also started my photography business (Koinonia).

          <h2> WHY CODING ?</h2>
          <p align="center" >I’ve been a little lost when it comes to what do as a career.
            I’ve always loved creating, wether it was  dancing competitvely,singing, 
            creating vlogs or photography. 
            I studied chemistry at university per my parents request but quickly 
            realised it wasn’t for me. 
            I continued with photography until some friends of mine recommended 
            that I look into web design. 
            I started learning a little through the ‘mimo’ app and found that I 
            enjoyed the combination of problem solving and creativity. 
            I hope to go into front end development and continue developing my 
            skills in a field that will never be boring. 
            I was actually directed to Founders and Coders by a complete stranger, 
            I said I was interested in getting into tech and she kindly sent me 
            some resources and information about this course.
